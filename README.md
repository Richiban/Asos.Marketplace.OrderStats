# Asos.Marketplace.OrderStats

This is a demo project to show how F# can be used to write a library that fits into Marketplace's overall architecture very well.

Notice that there is not a single occurrence of mutation anywhere in the program.

It's harder to see, but you'll also notice that every function is pure, too.
